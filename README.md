# Dark Messiah Mod Launcher
These are the files for the Dark Messiah Mod Launcher! They will always be THE most up to date files you can get, compared to ModDB/Nexus

This Mod Launcher is designed to work seamlessly with the many different mods, past and present, that exist for Dark Messiah, with the added benefit of streamlining how they are installed by players so you can get to kicking. We are releasing this because it brings more stability to the game, but also prepares us for combining the mods we have in development together. In true Dark Messiah fashion, YOU choose how you play the game!

## How to Install
1) Go to your Dark Messiah Might and Magic Singleplayer folder
2) Make a backup of your mm.exe file
3) Extract the contents of the RAR to this folder. If done right, you will get a prompt asking to overwrite the files. Press yes!
4) Go to Steam, hit Launch
5) Customize your mods, settings, and when ready launch with or without!

## Features

- Installing mods is just drag and drop. No more editing gameinfo.txt for new content!
  
- Want to make a mod? Just make a folder and json file, and you're good to go!
  
- Mods can create their own localization files, content folders, platform edits, launch parameters, autoexec.cfgs and even gameexec.cfgs that run automatically.
  
- Edit the order of mods, or disable whichever you don't feel like using. Click or DragNDrop your way to a customizable Dark Messiah experience!
  
- A bunch of unique settings like windowed mod, Steam Deck fixes, and resolution controls right in the menu.
  
- Includes a bunch of bug fixes so you can launch the game. Things like administrator access, having too many CPU cores, DirectX failures, and Large Address Aware are all baked into the launcher! ACTUALLY play the game!!

## Troubleshooting
- If you press play on steam and nothing happens, try launching the mm.exe file directly in the folder. Launch with mods, and it may shut the game down. That's okay, as it applies the patch for the game from there. Steam will now work properly.
  
- If you have any issues please join the wiltOS discord and get yourself a Dark Messiah role! We'll be happy to help
